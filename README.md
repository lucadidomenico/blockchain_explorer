This is the backend for my [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) clone. It is a simple blockchain explorer that allows you to search for blocks, transactions, and addresses.

You can find the frontend at: [https://github.com/lucadidomenico/blockchain_explorer_frontend](https://github.com/lucadidomenico/blockchain_explorer_frontend)
